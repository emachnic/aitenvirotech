# AIT Environmental Technology

This is the source for the redesigned [AIT Envirotech](http://rails.aitenvirotech.com) site. There are no tests currently because the site is on [RailsPlayground](http://railsplayground.net) and they only support Rails 3.0.0.beta3 right now and RSpec requires 3.0.0.beta4.

All source code property of AIT Environmental Technology and is in a public repository on [GitHub](http://github.com) by permission.
